                By 2016, we began to see the fruits of our labor as word spread about our work, leading us to our first major client â€” a regional retail chain. This was a pivotal moment for us, as it allowed us to hire our first employee. Emma stepped up to lead user experience design, while Liam and I focused on coding and project management.

                As we gathered to reflect on our incredible journey, hosting a community event to showcase local tech talent felt like the perfect way to give back and inspire the next generation of innovators. It reminded us that with passion, collaboration, and a bit of code, anything is possible.
